## Cleaner App

Cleaner App was created with the objective of helping the cleaners in the Docklands Private Collection Company to register the number of flats worked per day in an interactive system with persistent information

### Current Problem

* All the cleaners in Docklands Private Collection register the worked flats in paper sheets.
* Easy to lose the register.
* Difficult to manage since at the end of each month the cleaner has to create the invoice based on the paper registers.

### Solution

* Cleaner App provides a system to have a track of the worked flats per day.

### Future Work

* User-based system.
* Monthly reports.

### Build With


* [Laravel 5.6](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6)
* [Boostrap 3.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)	
* [Laravel Collective 5.4](https://laravelcollective.com/docs/5.0/html)
